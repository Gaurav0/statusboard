  - name: JavaScript Modules API
    summary: |
      Allows developers to import just the parts of Ember they want via a JavaScript
      (ES6) modules API.

      ```ts
      import Component from '@ember/component';
      ```
    description: |
      Now that modules are common placed, the above import of the `Ember` namespace feels outdated and monolithic.
      [RFC 176](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0176-javascript-module-api.md) was introduced to address that,
      providing a set of heuristics to help rationalize the surface of Ember's public API in a predictable manner,
      as well as a new modules API.

      Now, instead of doing the following when creating a controller:

      ```typescript
      import Ember from 'ember';

      export default Ember.Controller.extend({
      });
      ```

      You will be able to do:

      ```typescript
      import Controller from '@ember/controller';

      export default Controller.extend({
      });
      ```

      You can find the most up-to-date and complete mappings between the previous API and the new modules api at
      the [ember-rfc176-data](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-rfc176-data) repository.
      We also provide an [ember-modules-codemod](https://github.com/tomdale/ember-modules-codemod) so that you can easily migrate your project.

  - name: Router Service
    summary: |
      Routing is one of the pillars of Ember applications but interacting with it has been historically restricted.
      You had transition methods on Routes and Controllers, and `currentRouteName` in the application controller only.
      A router service is being introduced in phases so users can interact with routing in a richer fashion.
