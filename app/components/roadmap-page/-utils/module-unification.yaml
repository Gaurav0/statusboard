- name: Improved File Layout ("New Pods" or "Module Unification")
  summary: |
    Groups related files in Ember apps to ease access to commonly used files. This also lays the groundwork
    for long-term improvements to numerous areas in Ember.
  description: |
    The "New Pods" project (or "Module Unification") describes a new way to lay out Ember applications and
    addons in the `src/` directory (switching away from the `app/` folder).

    This new approach will replace both the traditional "classic" filesystem layout and also
    "pods". Pods were an initial experiment from the very early days of Ember-CLI (when it too was an experiment)
    Pods have been a huge success, but the initial experiment had some issues under-the-hood
    that we're now able to improve upon based on what we've learned as a community.

    This new design allows us to put related parts of the framework together such as templates,
    components, and component tests. It also makes it possible for components to reference relative
    components and provides the ability for addons to declare new module types.

    As part of the rework here, the rules for "resolving" files become much simpler,
    allowing for better app performance and compile-time optimizations. It also lays the ground work for
    automated code-splitting work to occur (see further down the page).
